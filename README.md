# The-Highway-Master
: To play, Use the arrow keys to accelerate and turn
: Use The Down Arrow key to slow down your car
: The faster you accelerate, The harder it gets
: However, it will be easier to get a higher score if your speed is high
: The speed limit is 200MPH
: Avoid the traffic 
: Try not to die
: Try to get as high of a score as possible 
: This program is run by hopes and prayers, so if you encounter a bug, give me feedback on how I can fix it
: Use Chrome for best results 
: And lastly, Enjoy!

Edit: Fixed a bug in which the game will end if you turn left at the start. The position of the car sprite has been updated.
Edit 2: Fixed ANOTHER bug where the cars would overlap each other

Note: Now, Going Below 9MPH will not increase your score. So,Try going a bit faster
